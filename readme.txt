- Evaluation Metrics

## Problem Statement
In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources.

## Business Use Cases
- **Energy Management for Households**: Monitor energy usage, reduce bills, and promote energy-efficient habits.
- **Demand Forecasting for Energy Providers**: Predict demand for better load management and pricing strategies.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify irregular patterns indicating faults or unauthorized usage.
- **Smart Grid Integration**: Enable predictive analytics for real-time energy optimization.
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduce carbon footprints and support conservation initiatives.

## Approach
1. **Data Understanding and Exploration**:
   - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and quality.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data points.
   - Parse date and time into separate features.
   - Create additional features such as daily averages, peak hours, or rolling averages.
   - Normalize or scale the data for better model performance.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identify relevant features for predicting global active power consumption.
   - Incorporate external data (e.g., weather conditions) if available.
4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, HistGradientBoosting, and XGBoost.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
   - Compare model performance and select the best-performing model.

## Results
- An accurate prediction model for household power consumption.
- Clear insights into key factors influencing energy usage.
- Visualization of energy trends and predictive performance.

## Project Evaluation Metrics
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Evaluates average error magnitude.
- **R-Squared (RÂ²)**: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Demonstrates understanding of influential factors.
- **Visualization Quality**: Assesses the effectiveness of graphical insights.
